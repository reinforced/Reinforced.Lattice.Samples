    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>
        You have some data in your database, but you need to display it in some projection (e.g. "not all fields"), probably using aggregate functions,
        and at the same time you want to avoid <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-issue" target="_blank">Select N+1 issue</a>
        in your table.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>There are 3 possible ways to map TSource to TRow in Reinforced.Lattice</p>
    <h3>Automatic mapping</h3>
    <p>
        In simple cases Reinforced.Lattice can map your data automatically. As you have seen at "Getting it Working" tutorial, Reinforced.Lattice has automatically determined which data to show,
        but you have not specified any additional settings to do that.
        That is because Reinforced.Lattice mapping at work: <i>Reinforced.Lattice automatically copies properties with matching names from <code>TSource</code> to <code>TRow</code>.</i> <a href="http://automapper.org" target="_blank">Automapper</a> behaves almost in the same way. Obviously, for some cases this approach is not applicable.
    </p>
    <h3>Manual mapping with <code>.MappedFrom</code></h3>
    <p>
        <code>.MappedFrom</code> extension allows you to point a <span class="tip" data-tip="delegate">delegate</span> that must be used to obtain specific <code>TRow</code>'s column value 
        from <code>TSource</code> instance:
    </p>
</div>
<pre class="language-csharp wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/mapped-from.cs">

</pre>
<div class="text">    
    <p>
        Noticable moments are:
    </p>
    <ul class="blogger-sans">
        <li><code>.MappedFrom</code> delegate is executed <b>after</b> fetching <code>TSource</code>'s set from data source</li>
        <li>If you use database and ORM with lazy loading enabled then it is bad idea to use <code>.MappedFrom</code> on joined aggregates - it will throw you into Select N+1 issue</li>        
        <li><code>.MappedFrom</code> works perfectly in conjunction with automatical mapping. If <code>.MappedFrom</code> delegate presents for particular <code>TRow</code>'s column then it will be used for mapping. 
        Otherwise - automaticall mapping wil be applied.
         </li>  
    </ul>
    <p>So you can use <code>.MappedFrom</code> for post-query model transformations. It is pretty flexible on simple models to be used with automatical mapping. Unfortunately, it is not usable with complext models because of Select N+1 issue. 

      </p>

<div class="text">
    <h3>Manual mapping using <code>.ProjectDataWith</code></h3>
    <p>
        For complex models you can use projection method. <code>.ProjectDataWith</code> is used to specify method that takes your <code>IQueryable&lt;TSource&gt;</code> and turns it to <code>IQueryable&lt;TRow&gt;</code>. 
        The trick is pretty simple: in case if you use ORM that translates LINQ to store internal query language (e.g. EF translates LINQ to SQL) then your projection method will also be processed by query translator and all the fields of projection will be calculated on the store side. It solves the Select N+1 issue but requires little bit more boilerplate code:
    </p>
</div>
<pre class="language-csharp wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/project-with.cs">

</pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>
        Noticable moments are:
    </p>
    <ul class="blogger-sans">
        <li><code>.ProjectDataWith</code> can be specified only once for table. All further calls to <code>.ProjectDataWith</code> will override projection.</li>
        <li>Automatic mapping does not work when projection specified</li>        
        <li>An attempt to use <code>.MappedFrom</code> in conjunction with <code>.ProjectDataWith</code> will lead to excetion - technically it is not possible to use <code>.ProjectDataWith</code> and <code>.MappedFrom</code> at the same time (since <code>.MappedFrom</code> consumes delegate, not expression)</li>  
        <li>You have to specify mapping for all properties. So if field <code>Id</code> presents both in <code>TSource</code> and <code>TRow</code> - you anyway will have to mention it in projection</li>        
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <h3>If nothing helped</h3>
    <p>
        If your model and projection query is too complex even for <code>.ProjectDataWith</code> then consider re-organizing your table e.g. by changing of your <code>IQueryable&lt;TSource&gt;</code> to other type (probably even <code>IQueryable&lt;TRow&gt;</code>) query. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="text tiptext" data-tiptext="delegate" data-caption=".MappedFrom consumes delegate">
    <p>
        Here I want to point that <code>.MappedFrom</code> method consumes <b>delegate</b> that takes <code>TSource</code> as input and produces result of matching column's type. Since it is <b>delegate</b>, not 
        <b>expression</b> - you easily can use any custom method to perform mapping for specified field. Therefore you are not limited to single expression.
