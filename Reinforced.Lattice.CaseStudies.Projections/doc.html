    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>
        You have some data in your database, but you need to display it in some projection (e.g. "not all fields"), probably using aggregate functions,
        and at the same time you want to avoid <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-issue" target="_blank">Select N+1 issue</a>
        in your table.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>There are 3 possible ways to map TSource to TRow in Reinforced.Lattice</p>
    <h3>Automatic mapping</h3>
    <p>
        In simple cases Reinforced.Lattice is able to map your data automatically. As you have seen at "Getting it Working" tutorial, Reinforced.Lattice has automatically determined which data to show,
        but you have not specified any additional settings to do that.
        That is because Reinforced.Lattice mapping at work. If you know project <a href="http://automapper.org" target="_blank">Automapper</a> then you are familiar with mapping process
        - it is almost similar in Reinforced.Lattice. Obviously, for some cases it is not applicable.
