    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>
        No one is going to observe 2000 of records at the same time. Reinforced.Lattice provides flexible and powerful data partition tools.
    </p>
    <h2>Necessary knowledge</h2>
    <h3>Partition</h3>
    <p>
        Reinforced.Lattice utilizes "partition" term to refer to data paging and sorting issues. Currently Reinforced.Lattice supports 3 different partition strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Client partition</b> - means almost "no partition". <i>This strategy is used by default</i>. When Reinforced.Lattice works in client partition mode then all the data is being retrieved to client-side, and if you want to use partition plugins (scrollbar, paging, and limit), then no additional server requests will be made. Server-side middleware of Reinfroced.Lattice does not generate additional <code>.Count()</code> call to your data storage, assuming that entire volume of data is received during first server request.
        </li>
        <li><b>Server partition</b> - in this mode Reinforced.Lattice retrieves data from the server on demand and does not store it locally. Server data partition means the ability of navigation to any data page and requires <code>.Count()</code> call to determine the total amount of data that is going to be processed. From UI side it looks like Reinforced.Lattice performs separate server request to obtain requested data page (and optionally few next pages) and does not store anything locally. Server partition is kind of "classical" and "default" behavior for datagrid frameworks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sequential partition</b> - is more complex case when you do not have ability to perform <code>.Count()</code> operation - data volume is too large or there is sequential-access datasource behind your <code>IQueryable&lt;TSource&gt;</code>. In this case Reinforced.Lattice will retrieve data from server page by page and store already fetched data on client-side allowing user to navigate to previously loaded data. Sequential partition does not allow user to obtain random page from server basically because even server does not know if such page exists.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is up to you to decide what partition strategy to use for particular situation.
    </p>
    <h3>Plugins</h3>
    <p>
        Also Reinforced.Lattice provides (for now) 3 plugins for navigation among partition data:        
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Paging plugin</b> - classical datagrid pager</li>
        <li><b>Scrollbar plugin</b> - virtualizing scrollbar. It is not possible to support built-in browser scrollbar for virtualization since such solution requires to know exact height of each scrollable element. Reinforced.Lattice provides extended templating capabilities, so it is technically not possible even to predict probable row height. So, Reinforced.Lattice contains own virtualizing scrollbar implementation out-of-the-box.</li>
        <li><b>Limit plugin</b> - this plugin is used to make user able to change size of visible data amount</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All these plugins are <b>fully</b> customizable from UI side (so you do no have to use additional frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/malihu/malihu-custom-scrollbar-plugin" target="_blank">jQuery custom content scroller</a>). Only you decide how they will look and where they will be placed. Also all these plugins can successfully be combined and used at the same time at the same table.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <h3>Define partition strategy</h3>
    <p>
        To define partition strategy call <code>.Partition</code> method of column configurator. It consumes partition configurator. Call:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>.Client()</code> to use client partition strategy. You can call it optionally as this strategy is used by default.</li>
        <li><code>.Server()</code> to use server partition strategy. As first parameter you can specify how much data pages you want to preload along with server requests</li>
        <li><code>.Sequential()</code> to use sequential partition strategy. You can also specify <code>loadAhead</code> by first parameter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Call <code>.InitialSkipTake</code> method to specify skip (row number to start retrieve data from) and take (size of data amount). Skip and take values have similar meaning as .NET <code>.Skip</code> and <code>.Take</code> LINQ methods. Basically <span class="tip" data-tip="confirmation">that is all</span> that no need to do to tell Reinforced.Lattice which partition strategy to use.

    <h3>How to display loading indicator</h3>
    <p>
        Loading indicator is very simple plugin that displays "loading" label when Reinforced.Lattice retreives data from server. It does not have any additional configuration and quite simple to use:
    </p>
</div>
<pre class="language-csharp wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/loading-plugin.cs"></pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>
        Here we also specify <i>where</i> to display loading label. "lt" is template region. Template regions are defined in core table layout template. Default bootstrap template has 8 template regions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"lt" - left-top corner</li>
        <li>"rt" - right-top corner</li>
        <li>"lb" - left-bottom corner</li>
        <li>"rb" - right-bottom corner</li>
        <li>and 4 more similar regions for toolbars (e.g. "toolbar-rt")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Template regions are described within case study about template regions. Here we just place loading indicator at the left-top corner.

    <h3>How to display results count selector</h3>
    <p>
        Use <code>.Limit</code> method:
    </p>
</div>
<pre class="language-csharp wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/limit-plugin.cs"></pre>
<div class="text">
    <h3>How to display paging control</h3>
    <p>
        Use <code>.Paging</code> method:
    </p>    
</div>
<pre class="language-csharp wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/paging-plugin.cs"></pre>
<div class="text">
    <h3>How to display scrollbar</h3>
    <p>
        Use <code>.Scrollbar</code> method:
    </p>    
</div>
<pre class="language-csharp wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/scrollbar-plugin.cs">

<div class="text tiptext" data-tiptext="confirmation" data-caption="Note about partition configuratio">
    <p>
        Actually that is not all. <code>.Server()</code> and <code>.Sequential()</code> methods have additional parameter that stands for fluent configuration. There you can configure so-called loading indicator that allows to perform "load more" button functionality and in-table loading indicator, but it will be discussed in separate case studied as it requires knowledge about core templating features.
