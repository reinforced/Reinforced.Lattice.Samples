    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>
        Table needs seaching (filtering) capabilities.
    </p>
    <h2>Necessary knowledge</h2>
    <h3>Filter types</h3>
    <p>
        Reinforced.Lattice has filters to perform filtering out non-satisfying data. It is possible to set up
        filters working on server side as well as client-side ones. Usually filters are being attached to columns,
        but there are some other use-cases. Basically, Reinforced.Lattice has 4 different types of client filters and it
        is enough since Reinforced.Lattice allows to easily customize UI and behavior:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Value filter</b>: exact filter. Being placed to particular column, filters out (removes) all rows that have corresponding column's value not equal to value put to filter.
            Actually it works in little bit different way for strings and dates
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Select filter</b>: technically the same as value filter, but its UI allows to choose one of several predefined options to filter by
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Multi-select filter</b>: almost the same as select filter, but allows to change several possible values values. Row will satisfy this filter in case if corresponding column's value matches one of selected values
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Range filter</b>: allows to filter out (hide) all the rows if their corresponding column's value is not in specified range.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using core templating, you can easily change supplied filter's UI without changing their logic.
    </p>
    <h3>Client and server filters</h3>
    <p>
        For each filter you can override server filtering criteria as well as client one.
        This process is pretty similar to <code>.Where</code> invokation even for client filtering (thanks to `{@}`-notation).
        Table <b>CAN</b> contain both client and server filters. So if you change client filter value then no additional server request will be performed.
        At the other hand, if you touch server filter then server request will happen.
        It is important to understand that <i>client filters are not bein executed on server</i>.
        So if you have table consisting of 1000 rows and 999 of them are filtered out by client filter -
        it means that 1000 records will be fetched from server.
        You can combine client and server filter and fine-tune your tables performance by that aspect.
    </p>
    <h3>Filtering of strings</h3>
    <p>
        Keep in mind that by default <i>server</i> value filter being attached to string column filters out all the rows
        that doesnt have corresponding columns <b>strictly</b> equal to specified filter value.
        At the other hand, client string filter works in <b>totatlly different manner</b>: it breaks input string into words
        and tries to match substring among all the options being filtered. This behavior takes place only for strings,
        so make sure to override client filtering function or just deal with such behavior.
    </p>
    <h3>How to connect your favorite date picker</h3>
    <p>
        Value filter being attached to <code>DateTime</code> or <code>DateTime?</code> column is being automatically turned to datepicker. With lattice you can use <b>any</b> third-party datepicker framework (I prefer bootstrap datepicker).
        To connect your favorite datepicker to lattice, you have to specify datepicker instatniation methods
        within <code>Configurator&lt;,&gt;.Datepcker</code> method invokation. It consumes instance of <code>DatepickerOptions</code> object, having constructor with 4 string parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>createDatepicker</code>: inline JS function or function name. Reinforced.Lattice calls this function when it needs to turn UI input to datepicker. It receives <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> HTML element instance as first parameter and flag that date is nullable as 2nd parameter.
            Inside of this function implementation you have to create datepicker wrapper around specified <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element or hide it and make your own, or whatever else. We are instantiating Bootstrap Datepicker here and also subscribe to its
            <code>changeDate</code> event, and fire <code>keyup</code> DOM event on original input - just because, Bootstrap Datepicker stops events propagation to original input.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>putToDatepicker</code>: this function is being called when Reinforced.Lattice needs to put existing date value to the date picker. Here, as first parameter you will receive <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element where you have to put date to and JS Date object instance
            as second parameter. You obviously have to set your date picker to specified date. Please note that passed date may be actually <code>null</code> - it depends on your column configuration
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>getFromDatePicker</code>: Reinforced.Lattice calls it when it needs to get value from datepicker. Corresponding <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element is being passed as 1st parameter. As return, Reinforced.Lattice expects JS Date object or null
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>destroyDatepicker</code>: this function must destroy datepicker object associated with corrsponding <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element. Reinforced.Lattice calls it to release memory from unnecessary datepicker. In order to use Bootstrap Datepicker, we call <code>$(element).datepicker('remove');</code> witin this function.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<pre class="language-cshtml wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/connect-datepicker.cshtml"></pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>
        Reinforced.Lattice uses specified datepicker methods for value filter, range filter and also for editing, forms, formwatch and other places. 
        So being specified once, your favorite datepicker will be used everywhere.
    </p>
</div>

<pre class="language-cshtml wrap-code" data-src="#doc#/connect-script.cshtml"></pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>
        Compare with <a href="#code__Layout_cshtml" data-inpage>my one</a> if you're not sure. We will need this "scripts" section later. It is critically important for
        it to follow <b>after</b> Reinforced.Lattice script connection.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3 - Prepare your ViewModel</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to your page's ViewModel</li>
        <li>Add <code>using</code> to <code>Reinforced.Lattice.Configuration</code> namespace</li>
        <li><span class="tip" data-tip="parametrization">Put a property</span> of type <code>Configurator&lt;User,UserRow&gt;</code> called Table to your ViewModel (<a href="#code_Index_cshtml">verify with my one if you aren't sure</a>)</li>
        <li>Create somewhere a <code>static</code> class - we will use it to store our table's configuration</li>
        <li>
            Navigate to static class created at previous step and create there <span class="tip" data-tip="extension">
                static method
            </span> consuming configurator as <code>this</code>-parameter and returning itself.
            Put some code using configurator into it. <a href="#code_UsersTable_cs">See how I do that</a>.
        </li>

    </ol>
    <p>
        <code>Configurator&lt;,&gt;</code> is key class exposing Reinforced.Lattice functionality. It is being used to produce piece of JSON code for client side as well as for
        maintaining upcoming requests to server side. And we have to keep it in the same (well, almost same) state both in our controller and in our ViewModel. That's why we use
        extension method for configuration.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4 - Prepare your page</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to your page that you want to put table to</li>
        <li>Pick a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or another tag you wish to display table in and assign <code>id="table"</code> to it</li>
        <li>
            Go to the bottom of the page and set up following code around your <code>scripts</code> section:
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<pre class="language-cshtml" data-src="#doc#/table-init.cshtml">
</pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>Basically that's how we use configurator to pass necessary data to our client script. <a href="#code_Index_cshtml">Check full page + ViewModel configuration</a>. </p>

    <h3>Step 5 - Prepare your controller</h3>
    <p>
        Now you have to make table crunch your <code>IQueryable&lt;TSource&gt;</code> and produce results. To do that you have to implement so-called "handle method" within your controller. Also add necessary initializations of your ViewModel with empty configurator, calling configuration method on it that you've created before. <br />
        <a href="#code_HomeController_cs" data-inpage>Please refer to controller class explained with comments</a> as it is too senseless to reveal it to step-by-step process.
    </p>
    <h3>And we are done here</h3>
    <p>
        After changing controller code you can press <kbd>F5</kbd> or <code>Run</code> button in your Visual Studio, or run local IIS and navigate to <code>/Home/Index</code> page. <br />
        Also you can launch live demo on all documentation pages using green "Live Demo" button.
    </p>

<div class="text tiptext" data-tiptext="vm" data-caption="About ViewModels">
    <p>
        Reinforced.Lattice ViewModels are of course are little bit different than regular MVC forms ViewModels.
        E.g. you do not have to put arrays of <code>SelectListItem</code>s to it. Also complex nested types are not allowed there.
        Optimal way is to keep you ViewModel for Lattice as <b>flat</b> and as plain-est as possible. Try to put actually all the fields
        that you are displaying to there. Of course, Lattice works with nested types, but it <i>may</i> reduce performance.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="text tiptext" data-tiptext="parametrization" data-caption="About Configurator parametrization">

    <b>NB! <code>Configurator&lt;,&gt;</code> type parameters. Learn them clearly.</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>TSource</code> - first one. Is actually type of data from your ORM. It is safe to put entities from DataContext/DbContext here.
            Also may be referred as "first", "left", "source", "from".
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>TRow</code> - second one. Is actually type of your ViewModel for <i>single row in table</i>.
            Also may be referred as "second", "right", "target", "to"
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Do not mess them - there 2 types are your best friends. It is important to understand what is applicable to <code>TSource</code> and what is applicable to <code>TRow</code>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="text tiptext" data-tiptext="extension" data-caption="About Configuration extensions">
    <p>
        In Reinforced.Lattice table configurations are maintained as C# <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx" target="_blank">extension methods</a> implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface" target="_blank">fluent interface configuration</a>.
        So you can chain your configurations methods and therefore combine configurations obtaining new configurations. <br />
        No XML configuration, no <a href="https://datatables.net/" target="_blank">JSON configuration</a>, no <a href="https://demos.devexpress.com/MVCxGridViewDemos/" target="_blank">assigning properties</a>, even
        no <a href="https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid" target="_blank">creating separate web project to enable grids</a>! Just clear, precise, chainable and maintainable fluent configuration. <br />
        Unfortunately you cannot chain configurations for cells templating, but you can do lot more other fun with them.
